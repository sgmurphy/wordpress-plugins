Rename filenames and media metadata for SEO and tidyness. Using AI, manually, in bulk, or in so many other ways!

== Description ==

Automatically gives your media files and their details — Title, ALT Text, and Description — a new, better name, for SEO and tidiness. It's smart enough to offer suggestions using various methods, including AI, and lets you make changes manually too.

Whether you're uploading new files or want to update your whole media library at once, this plugin makes it easy and does a lot of the work for you.

Your WordPress becomes cleaner, more organized, and more efficient. Please visit the official website for more information: Media File Renamer.

=== Compatibility ===

Media File Renamer is compatible with a wide range of WordPress features and plugins, including support for Retina and WebP images, re-scaled images from WP 5.3 onwards, PDF Thumbnails, UTF8 files, and optimized images. It's designed to handle various encoding types, ensuring your media library is always organized. Some page builders like Avia Layout Builder may limit renaming due to encryption.

=== Pro Version ===

In the [Pro Version](https://meowapps.com/media-file-renamer/), you'll find many exciting features, like AI Vision and Suggestions for smart renaming, and anonymize your files for extra privacy. Easily move files across directories in bulk, sync metadata such as ALT texts and titles, and even number your files for better organization.

=== Important ===

Renaming or moving files can be risky, so it's vital to take precautions and make a backup before using Media File Renamer. Start by renaming files individually to ensure page references update correctly, as some plugins might interfere with the process. If issues arise post-renaming, try clearing your cache to fix outdated references. Still facing problems? Utilize the Undo feature to revert filenames.
