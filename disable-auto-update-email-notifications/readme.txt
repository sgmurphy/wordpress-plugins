This plugin performs a simple task of disabling email notifications that are sent by WordPress when a plugin or theme auto-updates.

== Description ==
Since WordPress 5.5, if you have enabled plugin or theme auto-update you will receive an email notification when a plugin or them auto-update is successful or when it has failed.  

If you manage a dozen of websites, then the constant stream of auto-update emails may be annoying. 

This plugin seeks to cure the problem by automatically disabling plugin and themes email auto-update notifications.  

All other notification will be ON. This plugin only stops plugin and theme auto-update notifications. Not core WordPress updates.
