### Truly Advanced WordPress Reset

Whether you're seeking simplicity or in-depth customization, this plugin offers you 3 powerful core Reset options that cater to most WordPress Reset needs:

#### Site Reset

This is the most commonly used website Reset option as it preserves your data and focuses the Reset on the database and its content.

Elements that are removed are:

* Pages, Posts and Comments
* Custom tables
* Users (except the current admin user)
* After the Reset, the following will remain untouched:

Elements that are kept are:

* The current admin user
* Files, Uploads, Themes, Child themes, Plugins, etc.
* Basic WP settings like Site title, WP address, Site address, Time zone & Language
* Non-WordPress Database Tables

Site Reset is the ideal way to start over fresh without having to re-upload all your images & videos, reconfigure user access, reinstall themes and plugins‚Ä¶

#### Nuclear Reset (Pro feature)

Choose this option for a total reboot. This in-depth reset removes almost everything, from files to custom settings and database tables. It's the closest you‚Äôll get to a fresh WordPress install without the hassle.

The only things that are kept after a Nuclear Reset are: 

* The current user for you to log in
* This plugin‚Äôs files and data
* Non-WordPress Database Tables

#### Custom Reset (Pro feature)

If none of the above ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù options fits your needs, try the Custom Reset option for even more control and flexibility. Set exactly what you want to reset and what you want to keep untouched:

* Choose which themes to activate, deactivate, or delete after the Reset
* Choose which plugins to activate, deactivate, or delete after the Reset
* Decide which users to keep after the Reset
* Customize your blog info after the reset
* You can also choose to keep things are they are for each element

Once you‚Äôre happy with your choices, you can save your preferences in a Custom reset for easy later use. Repeat this process as needed, and you‚Äôll end up with your very own library of tailored Resets!

As you can see, the Custom Reset feature provides you with full control over your Reset process.

In addition to the 3 core options above, we also have numerous individual reset tools that can be used to conduct laser-targeted partial resets of specific parts of your WordPress site. 

For instance, you could choose to exclusively reset your menus and widgets while leaving the rest untouched.

### Tools & Collections for Partial Resets and Beyond

The Tools section is an extension of the 3 main Reset options above that enables you to perform laser-targeted and custom partial Resets.

With an extensive library of Tools, you can have the most precise and granular control over what you want to reset using specific tools:

* Reset the ‚Äòuploads‚Äô folder (/wp-content/uploads) by deleting all its content. This includes images, videos, music, documents, subfolders, etc.
* Reset Themes by deleting all themes (the plugin uses WordPress core functions to delete themes). You can keep the currently active theme or delete it as well
* Delete all plugins (the plugin will deactivate them first then uninstall them using WordPress core functions)
* Reset ‚Äúwp-content‚Äù folder. All files and folders inside ‚Äò/wp-content‚Äô directory will be deleted and reset, except ‚Äòindex.php‚Äô and the following folders: ‚Äòplugins‚Äô, ‚Äòthemes‚Äô, ‚Äòuploads‚Äô, and ‚Äòmu-plugins‚Äô
* Delete Must-use plugins. All MU plugins in ‚Äò/wp-content/mu-plugins‚Äô will be deleted. These are plugins that cannot be disabled except by removing their files from the must-use directory
* Delete ‚Äú.htaccess‚Äù file. This is a critical WordPress core file used to enable or disable features of websites hosted on Apache. In some cases, you may need to delete it to do some tests
* Delete all comments. All types of comments including published, pending, spam, trashed‚Ä¶ will be deleted. Comments meta will also be deleted
* Delete pingbacks. Pingbacks allow you to notify other website owners that you have linked to their article on your website
* Delete trackbacks. Although there are some minor technical differences, a trackback is the same thing as a pingback
* ‚Ä¶

The above Tools can also be used to clean up and optimize a WordPress site in order to save disk space, improve performance, or simply reduce security risks by getting rid of unsafe plugins, themes, and files. the possibilities are endless and the only limit is your creativity!

To enable such advanced creative use cases, the Pro version of Advanced WordPress Reset lets you build **Collections** of tools where you can pick and choose the tools you want to include in a collection. Once a collection is built and saved, you will be able to run all the tools it contains with a single click of the mouse saving you valuable time and hassle.

To take things even further and empower our power users, the Pro version of the plugin has powerful automation and scheduling features that let you choose the time and frequency at which a collection is executed automatically by the system without the need for you to log in and run it manually.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVJrKj9plpQ]

Whether it is a custom Partial Reset Collection, Cleanup Collection, or Optimization Collection‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be able to automate and schedule its execution with unparalleled ease and control.

When used together, Collections and Scheduling become powerful tools to improve productivity and save time on repetitive yet essential tasks like maintenance or recurring environment resets. We‚Äôve listed a few real-world use cases below for your reference.

### Snapshots and Restoration to the Rescue

Because Resets perform critical actions on your database and contents with potentially catastrophic consequences on your site, it was imperative to include additional safety mechanisms you could resort to if need be.

Snapshots are a simple yet powerful way of taking full copies of your database to provide you with an invaluable safety net in case things go south. Simply restore your snapshot and you should be good to go.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3E9LbLa3QI]

In other words, Snapshots create an undo button for Resets as far as database data is concerned. That‚Äôs why we highly recommend that you systematically take a snapshot of your site‚Äôs database before any Reset.

In fact, it‚Äôs always a good idea to take multiple snapshots at different points in time so you can have more than one option if you need to revert to a previous state of your site.

Since snapshots are similar in a way to backups, they can also be used to restore a hacked or damaged database. However, please understand that Snapshots DO NOT replace backups as they don‚Äôt save a copy of your files. We thus recommend you use one of the numerous backup tools available.

Even though taking a snapshot is free, quick and easy, our users are sometimes too busy or simply forget to do so. That‚Äôs why the plugin comes with a powerful scheduling Pro feature that automates the whole process for you. Just choose the options that best suit your needs and the system will take care of the rest for you.

### WP Switcher for in-depth compatibility Testing (Pro feature)

Plugin and Theme developers rely on our plugin to speed up their tests and troubleshoot their creations. However, such tests are only as good as the version they are run on.

With WP Switcher, a unique feature in Advanced WordPress Reset, we make switching from one WordPress version to another a breeze! Now, you can truly ensure the compatibility of your plugin or theme across different WordPress versions by proactively detecting and addressing any version-specific issues.

WP Switcher offers a convenient one-click feature for changing versions, making it effortless to upgrade or downgrade your existing WordPress version.

By utilizing the power of WP Switcher, you can expedite your testing workflow, making sure your projects operate flawlessly across all relevant WordPress versions.

= Q1: Is Advanced WordPress Reset suitable for beginners? =

Yes, our plugin is designed to cater to both beginners and experienced users. It offers an intuitive solution for efficient site management, making it suitable for those new to WordPress as well as experienced developers.

These measures are designed to protect against unintentional human errors and unfortunate mishaps.

= Q3: How does the plugin help in recovery scenarios? =

The plugin's primary function is to reset your site to its default state. This becomes a powerful tool for recovery purposes, especially in cases of hacks, corruption, or conflicts caused by plugins. By reverting to a clean slate, you can efficiently troubleshoot and resolve these issues.
