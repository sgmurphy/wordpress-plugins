== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =
Since there are so many themes, compatibility with all of them is barely possible. In general, though, if the theme is developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, BeRocket plugins are compatible with it.


= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =
If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to make sure the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Make sure your plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce versions (if required) are updated and the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!


= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =

Here you can read more about the premium features of the plugin and make it give it its best shot!
