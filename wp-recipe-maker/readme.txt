== Frequently asked questions ==

= Where can I find a demo and some more documentation? =
Check out the [WP Recipe Maker sales site](https://bootstrapped.ventures/wp-recipe-maker/), [demo website](https://demo.wprecipemaker.com) and [WPRM documentation](https://help.bootstrapped.ventures/collection/1-wp-recipe-maker) for more information on all of the features!

= What's the difference with WP Ultimate Recipe? =

[WP Ultimate Recipe](http://www.wpultimaterecipe.com/) is the popular recipe plugin that we released in 2013 and have been working on ever since. This gave us a great idea of what most food bloggers are looking for.

Why the new plugin? A few structural choices we made early on have caused WP Ultimate Recipe to be quite complex and not 100% compatible with all themes. With WP Recipe Maker we're building the perfect recipe plugin from scratch, without all the baggage of years of development.

WP Ultimate Recipe is still in active development and will be maintained alongside this new alternative.

= Do you offer any support? =

Yes! We pride ourselves on offering awesome support and almost always answer support questions within 24 hours. Send us an email at [support@bootstrapped.ventures](mailto:support@bootstrapped.ventures) whenever you have a question or suggestion!
