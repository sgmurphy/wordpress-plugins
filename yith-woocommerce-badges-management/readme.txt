YITH WooCommerce Badge Management allows you to create and manage custom badges for products.

== Description == 

Product badges are a great tool to increase sales in your e-commerce, as you can highlight key products (new, popular, featured, etc.) or product details. You can even use badges to tap into powerful psychological triggers such as scarcity, social proof, and urgency to boost sales.

The big e-commerce stores use badges to highlight discounts and promotions (it’s the typical badges showing the discount percentage that you can find on most online stores!) and also to quickly inform users with visual tools: for example, if you sell cosmetics online, you can use the badges to add a label like “Cruelty-free”; if you sell food, you can create badges to highlight vegan or gluten-free products; if you sell clothes, you can create badges that let you quickly spot “plus-size” or “maternity clothes” products and so on. The badge builder gives you unlimited possibilities, as it allows you to create unlimited badges for your products.
