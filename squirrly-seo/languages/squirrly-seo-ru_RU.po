If you have pages in your SEO strategy that are super important (you NEED those pages to be found via search) make sure you add:  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, nofollow\" /> This ensures that Google considers this a final page. If many other pages link on to this page and this is the final one, it means that it is the most valuable resource. %s Identify links on your pages that are not important for you or for the purpose of the site itself. Maybe you're sending a link to chef Jamie Oliver's recipe for hot sauce. You should make sure that you add the No Follow tag to that link going out of your site, because you don't want Google to pass on link juice to Jaime Oliver. You'd give him a part of your SEO Authority and you don't want that. You should also add No-Follow tags to internal links from your very own site. Add no-follow to pages like \"/login\", \"/register\" \"/terms-of-use\", which are not important to be found via search engines. %s  Add rel=\"nofollow\" to links inside your pages to fix this task.
