It will keep bringing you traffic. Of course, the key is to first make these items visible in the places where you publish them. %s You need an email list. Make sure that people who come to your store, do business with you, visit your website, or read your blog give you their email address so you can communicate with them further on. An alternative to this is to make a Chatbot for Facebook Messenger and get them hooked to the bot.
