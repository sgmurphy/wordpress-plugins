### SEO Plugin by Squirrly SEO Newton: the #1 Holistic SEO Software + WordPress SEO Plugin, powered by AI.

Your **SEO challenges** - solved.

Introducing: the first AI-driven, holistic SEO assistant.

Smart business owners prefer a single, integrated platform like Squirrly SEO: Newton. With it, businesses can streamline their SEO processes, ensuring that every aspect of SEO—from keyword research to performance tracking—is harmonized and easily manageable from one centralized location. This integration significantly reduces complexity, saves time, and improves the effectiveness of SEO initiatives.

You can start implementing Holistic SEO, driven with the power of two different AIs we have in the free version of Squirrly SEO.

This is the AI SEO Plugin you were looking for.

In 2024, Google is analyzing more ranking factors than ever. We know that because our custom-built AI, called Ranking Vision AI, keeps learning and adapting the scores we reference inside our SaaS+plugin setup.

If you only work on one aspect, for example: technical SEO, your SEO just won't work. - this was possible years ago, but no longer possible with today's Google algorithm updates.

You need a Holistic approach to win, and you need to take good care of all your marketing aspects. Squirrly SEO is the only one to help you with that.

With two powerful AIs inside, you'll always know what to do, what to target to attract more clients and how to focus on exactly the next steps that will improve rankings.

One AI, is custom-built by our company, using years of study on hundreds of thousands of websites.  <a title="Mady by Squirrly" href="https://www.squirrly.co/marketingtools/ranking-vision-ai/">Ranking Vision AI</a>

The other one is an AI we developed for Keyword Research and Keyword Analysis (based on GPT4). <a title="Innovating on GPT4" href="https://www.squirrly.co/marketingtools/keyword-research-tool-ai-update/">AI Keyword Research Tools</a>

With these two AIs and Squirrly SEO's holistic approach to SEO, you will use the Full Force of SEO to outrank your competitors.

Full Force of SEO. And Force is measure in Newton, for those of you who want to know why we chose the new name.

Without implementing Holistic SEO and being guided through the process by an AI, those results would have been impossible to achieve with plugins that don't offer real SEO tools, like the ones you expect from Ahrefs and SEMrush.

**"I've used many other SEO plugins out there: Yoast, Rank Math, WP All in One SEO, but Squirrly has outclassed them all."**

I'm a Search Engine Optimization professional with 4 years of experience and from now on this product will be my go-to when implementing SEO strategies for my clients. 

It's extremely easy to use, self-explanatory, and will definitely work great for those who don't have much SEO experience.

Squirrly SEO: Newton is the first "AI-driven, holistic SEO assistant" that simplifies complexity, making it the go-to solution for business owners and entrepreneurs.

SEO is complex because Google wants it to be (and let's be honest for a moment: it needs it to be).

Remember a few months ago when everyone tried to game the FAQ schemas? - they figured it out and removed them.

In 2024, SEO is not a one trick pony anymore. SEO can be completely NOT overwhelming at all if:

1. You don't (yes, do not) do SEO the right way and focus only on meta tags or getting rich snippets for the site. Or any of these: "I need to do only one thing approaches." - it won't be overwhelming, but it won't help you either. Good luck ranking like that.

2. You use the Next SEO Goals feature from your Squirrly SEO, and only work on what's needed, when it's needed, using exactly the tools it tells you to use. - which is the smart way of working on your SEO, backed by real data, not guesswork and weird luck.

The goals are tailored to each site and set of focus pages you choose (for real; many claim this, but they don't have any system in place).

And then you get to be walked through all the complexities analyzed by Focus Pages (which take you from basic SEO to actual Holistic SEO, so you can use the full force to your advantage). However, with Next SEO Goals you'll be able to fully focus on the next step that drives bigger rankings.

The people who were successful with Squirrly SEO have used the Next SEO Goals to work on what matters (because our systems analyze data from WP and also from many of our cloud services). Some of them have even gone through the 14 Days Journey to learn more about SEO.

They have chosen option number 2.

When you look at this table, where you see that your version of Squirrly SEO does a lot more than Ahrefs (for the usecases we target), SEMrush, Yoast, Rank Math, it may feel overwhelming.

But it doesn't have to be if you start working with the AI Consultant we've built.

You can use Squirrly SEO on easy mode or on hard mode. It's up to you and your skill level.

But don't worry: using it on easy mode will get you plenty results. Once you learn more about SEO, you'll be able to use more of the tools inside and make more customizations.

It's SaaS+plugin. Our plugin loads fast, and the real heavy lifting is done by our company's servers, not yours. Doesn't matter if you don't use one of the tools right now. It doesn't cost you "compute" - I hate that term, but it's so fresh.

In the beginning: stick with the Next SEO Goals and if you're a bit more advanced work on your Holistic SEO with Focus Pages and focus on turning red elements to green.

That's how you win. - Focus Pages is the way, once you get to know Squirrly SEO better. Ranking Vision AI powers its Chances of Ranking score, and I think it's the only AI of its kind.

<h3>In fact, Squirrly covers everything you need to optimize and be successful with WordPress SEO.</h3>

**Over 650 features pre-configured for you during install**, so that you don't have to work on configurations!

Check out every single feature you can get inside: <a title="All Features" href="https://seotools.completeseofunnel.com/">Every single feature</a>

Squirrly SEO has all important settings done for you right as you start and complete the setup wizard.

No need to go back and forth between tabs to do keyword research, create SEO content, completely optimize your website and pages, and track their SEO performance. 

SEO optimization has never been easier. 

**Safely migrate your data** to Squirrly SEO from any of the following:

- Rank Math, Yoast, All in One SEO, SEO Framework, SEO Press, SEO Pressor, Add Meta Tags Plugin, Gregs High Performance SEO, Headspace 2, Platinum SEO Pack, SEO Title Tags, SEO Ultimate Plugin.


★★★★★

"When you're new to SEO like me, some dark corners of content optimization can be hard to figure out. With Squirrly SEO's full suite of tools, all I have to do is follow their instructions."

It is straightforward, so anyone can use this easy-to-use tool by simply following the navigation they're given, giving you undeniable confidence that if you put work into your site, you will get the results you want!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Squirrly together with Rank Math? Could I replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO alongside Rank Math if you want to, as Squirrly enables you to deactivate certain settings or modules so that Squirrly SEO and Rank Math can work in compatibility mode.

If Squirrly stops handling source code changes, then it works with Rank Math, SEOpress, All In One SEO SEO, Yoast, and others. Regarding whether you could replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly SEO, this graphic linked below shows you a side-by-side comparison of Squirrly SEO vs. Rank Math.

There are around 650 features in Squirrly SEO, most of which can’t be found in Rank Math, given that Rank Math does not offer a duality between plugin and cloud services.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/wordpress-seo/use-squirrly-in-compatibility-mode-with-other-seo-plugins/

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/#vsrankmath

= Can we import data from Rank Math into Squirrly SEO? =
Yes, you can easily import all settings and all page optimizations made with Rank Math, using our import features. This provides step-by-step documentation on how to migrate your data from Rank Math so that you don’t lose your previous SEO optimization. 

https://howto12.squirrly.co/wordpress-seo/how-to-switch-from-rank-math-to-squirrly-seo/

= Are Focus Pages similar to Pillar Content in Rank Math? =
You can search for “focus pages” on this page:

https://www.squirrly.co/wordpress/plugins/second-seo-features-page/

You will see there all that it offers. It is incredibly valuable for SEO and does everything required for SEO, unlike the pillar feature in Rank Math. It offers more than even Moz or Ahrefs does in terms of content analysis. 

Side by side comparison: Squirrly SEO versus Rank Math 

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/#vsrankmath

Powered by advanced cloud servers owned by the Squirrly Company, the MarketIntelligence big data analysis we do, and data sources like: Moz, Majestic, Alexa, Semrush, Google Analytics, ContentLook, crawlers owned by Squirrly: we are in a unique position that allows us to do in-depth content analysis and see each page the same way that Google’s algorithms see it.

= How does Squirrly, marketing and marketshare wise, compete with SEOPress, Rank Math, All in One SEO? =
We have been around since 2012 and we’ve validated over 17 products already with money paid by customers. There are few startups that could show the same results. 

Get a more detailed response here. 

https://howto12.squirrly.co/faq/how-does-squirrly-marketing-and-marketshare-wise-compete/

= Can the Squirrly SEO plugin be used together with Yoast,  SEOPress, Rank Math, Premium SEO Pack, All in One SEO, SEO Framework? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO alongside other SEO plugins like Yoast, Rank Math, SEO Press, Premium SEO Pack, All in One SEO, or SEO Framework in compatibility mode. 

You can learn more about how to use Squirrly SEO in compatibility mode here. 

https://howto12.squirrly.co/wordpress-seo/use-squirrly-in-compatibility-mode-with-other-seo-plugins/

If Squirrly stops handling source code changes, then it works with Rank Math, SEOpress, SEO Pressor, All in One SEO, Yoast, SEO Framework, and others.

Basically, you can use Squirrly SEO to power up WP on top of everything that is already handled by the other WordPress SEO plugin you’re using. Of course, you can also decide to switch to Squirrly, as it offers the complete SEO funnel.

Check out these graphics

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/

to see how Squirrly compares to other SEO plugins such as Yoast, Rank Math, SEOPress, SEO Framework, and All in One SEO.

= How does Squirrly compare with plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in one SEO, or Yoast in terms of site speed and pagespeed? =
Most of the processing, data storage, and other things that only Squirrly SEO can do, are actually things that happen on our Cloud Servers. The duality between plugin and Cloud Services (APIs, crawlers, big data, A.I., MarketIntelligence services) allows us to load the plugin’s code very fast.

The duality between SEO plugin and Cloud Services gives us an advantage over other WordPress SEO plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in One SEO, Rank Math, and Yoast.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/faq/how-does-squirrly-compare-site-speed/

= Does Squirrly SEO Have a Redirection feature? =

Snippets in All Snippet – Bulk SEO

Snippet on the Front-End

It’s a new way of doing re-directs and complements our automatic redirection feature.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/seo-links/

= Is there a Way to Remove the no-index Pages from the XML Sitemap? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO to remove the no-index pages from the XML sitemap. 

You can do this by post type using the SEO Settings > Automation functionality. Simply select the post type and switch off: “Include In XML Sitemap”.

More details about how to remove no-index pages from the XML sitemap can be seen here.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/seo-automation/#send_to_sitemap

Or you can remove the no-index pages from the xml sitemap at an URL level by editing the SEO Snippet and then selecting “Visibility”.

More details about this xml sitemap option can be seen here.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/bulk-seo/#bulk_seo_visibility

= Does WordPress SEO Plugin by Squirrly Have an Option for submitting new URLs to Google Search Console to be Indexed? =

More details about this here.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/sitemap-xml-settings/

= What Special Features Does SEO Plugin by Squirrly Offer for Local SEO? =
Squirrly provides Schema for Local Business. Coordinates, hours, menus, etc. are available. You can learn more about this here.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/json-ld-structured-data/

Meta Data for GEO and Location – Especially helpful for Local SEO and Knowledge Graph

Add Coordinates for Local SEO and add the address of your main location.
This will be used for your Organization and for Publisher details within your WordPress site.

Schema for Local SEO can now be built directly from WordPress – Squirrly – SEO Settings – JSON-LD.

For multiple locations, you can build the Schema using the Editor we give access to and the Custom Code option for Schema.

We’ve even added KML files recently so you can easily add your local business to Google Earth and our integration actually works.

= What Dedicated Features Does Squirrly Offer for News Websites? =
- Build XML Sitemap for Google News (you can learn more about this here)
- XML Sitemap Settings: Blogging Frequency. You have the option to select Every Day as your blogging frequency or even Every Hour.
- Ping New Posts to Search Engines. Pinging is a process by which Squirrly SEO can notify search engines that your xml sitemap has been updated.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/sitemap-xml-settings/#news_sitemap

= With Squirrly, can specific pictures for social media shares of pages and posts be used? =
Yes, you can customize the Open Graph and Twitter Card image for every page and post using Bulk SEO or the Squirrly SEO Snippet.

You can learn more about these features here.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/bulk-seo/

= How is Squirrly Addressing the Core Web Vitals SEO Scoring Method? =
Squirrly is addressing them with Focus Pages.

Page experience has been one of the main reasons we’ve created Focus Pages and it goes a little beyond just pagespeed and coding propriety.

Time on page, bounce rates, number of pages visited are also very important and we’re getting clear signals that their importance is shifting.

We already address pagespeed and https and give resources to our users, so they are prepared for the update.

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/focus-pages-page-audits/

= What is the advantage of using Squirrly’s keyword research tool instead of using an external tool for this? =
Squirrly’s built-in keyword research tool allows you to perform keyword research without leaving WordPress.

Furthermore, Squirrly also provides access to features like Briefcase, which means you can not only find keywords but also organize them into tighter groups for a better strategy. Furthermore, our keyword research data is fresh, since we don’t use caching (cached databases). 

Maximum caching time is about 48 hours, not a whole year or two years like you find in other tools.

As we use Google API for search volume, Social Media for discussions, the data should be fresh every time and this is why it is different from others – and also why the data we show is different from what you may find in other keyword research tools who use caching for their data. (caching time can be extremely high for some of those tools).

https://howto12.squirrly.co/kb/keyword-research-and-seo-strategy/

= Can you guarantee SEO results? =
If you follow what we outline here, then yes. We will guarantee (please read the following resource):

https://plugin.squirrly.co/squirrly-seo-pro-results-guarantee/

= Why is Squirrly Keyword Research better than Google Keyword Planner for SEO strategies? =

Because our tool focuses on the information your need to better rank on Google not to get your Ads in front of more people. Google Keyword Planner is a great research tool if you are creating Adwords campaigns. For SEO our keyword generator tool is better.

= I can't log into the Wordpress with my user. Get the message 'An error occured.' What can I do? =
I see that your host server is not letting you access our remote API.
Please tell your webmaster to add the IPs 176.9.121.162 and 176.9.112.210 in the white-list for remote access and it should work.
