**Integration with Sentry, Report URI, URIports and Datadog**
Sentry is a well-known platform for monitoring and tracking errors in applications. By integrating Sentry with our plugin, users can:
  * Receive detailed reports on content security policy (CSP) violations.
  * Monitor and analyze JavaScript exceptions occurring on their site.
  * Benefit from advanced tools for proactive troubleshooting.

Monitoring and Integration with Sentry, Datadog and URI Reports for optimal security.

**All Free Features**
The **Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP** version includes all the free features.

We have implemented **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**, using best practices. First, using **Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP** prevents the browser from including your site in the "cohort calculation" on **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**. This means that nothing can call document.interestCohort() to get the FLoC ID of the currently used client. Obviously, this does nothing outside of your currently visited site and does not "disable" FLoC on the client beyond that scope.

Even though **FLoC** is still fairly new and not yet widely supported, as programmers we think that privacy protection elements are important, so we choose to give you the feature of being opt out of FLoC! We’ve created a special **“automatic blocking of FLoC”** feature, trying to always **offer the best tool with privacy protection and cyber security** as main targets and focus.

Analyze your site before and after using *Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP* security headers are self-configured according to HTTP Security Headers and HTTP Strict Transport Security / HSTS best practices.

I chose Sentry, URIports, Datadog, and Report URI for integration with this plugin because they are highly reputable and functional platforms in the field of security monitoring. Here's a brief overview of each:

**Sentry**

= Can I view CSP reports directly in Sentry? =

Yes, all CSP reports will be sent to Sentry, where you can view and analyze them in the Sentry control panel.

= How do you get an A+ grade? =

To earn an A+ grade, your site must issue all HTTP response headers that we check. This indicates a high level of commitment to improving the security of your visitors.

= What headers are recommended? =

Over an HTTP connection we get Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options and X-XSS-Protection. Via an HTTPS connection, 2 additional headers are checked for presence which are Strict-Transport-Security and Public-Key-Pins.

* Once the plug-in is activated it performs a test (before and after): <a href="https://securityheaders.com/" target="_blank">https://securityheaders.com/</a>

= Can the plugin create slowdowns? =

No, Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP is Fast, Secure and does not affect the SEO and speed of your website.

= What is HSTS (Strict Transport Security)? =

It was created as a solution to force the browser to use secure connections when a site is running on HTTPS. It is a security header that is added to the web server and reflected in the response header as Strict-Transport-Security. HSTS is important because it addresses the following anomalies:

= Check before and after using Preload HSTS =

This step is important to submit your website and/or domain to an approved HSTS list. Google officially compiles this list and it is used by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE11 and Edge. You can forward your site to the official HSTS preload directory. ('https://hstspreload.org/')

= how to use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) =

If you want to use Preload HSTS for your site, there are a few requirements before you can activate it.

* Have a valid SSL certificate. You can't do any of this anyway without it.
* You must redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS (recommended via permanent 301 redirects). This means that your site should be HTTPS only.
* You need to serve all subdomains in HTTPS as well. If you have subdomains, you will need an SSL certificate.

The HSTS header on your base domain (for example: example.com) is already configured you just need to activate the plug-in.

If you want to check the HSTS status of your site, you can do so here: <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank">https://hstspreload.org/</a>

= Can I report a bug or request a feature? =

You can report bugs or request new features right <a href="mailto:support@tentacleplugins.com">support@tentacleplugins[dot]com</a>

= Disable FLoC, Google's advertising technology =

FLoC is a mega tracker that monitors user activity on all sites, stores the information in the browser, and then uses machine learning to place users into cohorts with similar interests. This way, advertisers can target groups of people with similar interests. Plus, according to Google's own testing, FLoC achieves at least 95% more conversions than cookies.

= Who is disabling FLoC by Google? =

Scott Helme reported that as of May 3, already 967 of the first 1 million domains had disabled FLoC's interest-cohort in their Permissions-Policy header. That list included some big sites like The Guardian and IKEA.

= Do you use CloudFlare and the Headers Security Advanced & HSTS WP plugin? =

Are you experiencing any anomalies after a plugin update? If yes, please follow these instructions: clear the cache directly to the CloudFlare Client Area

* Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard, and select your account and domain.
* Select Caching > Configuration.
* Under Cache Purge, select Custom Purge. The custom purge window will be displayed.
