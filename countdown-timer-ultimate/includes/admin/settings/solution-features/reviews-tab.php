					<h3 class="wpcdt-testimonial-title">Best Features And Great Support</h3>
					<div class="wpcdt-testimonial-desc">Iâ€™ve tried other countdowns, theyâ€™re all based on similar Javascript, but what Ultimate doesnâ€™t do is limit the styles of theirs to Pro versions, whereas others, like countdown builder, do! Ketan went above and beyond with a fix that was related to my css, not his code. Excellent plugin, outstanding developer. Many thanks.</div>

						<h3 class="wpcdt-testimonial-title">Functional and customizable</h3>
						<div class="wpcdt-testimonial-desc">It works and supports extra customization and styling. I like that in the new version when timer reaches zero it disappears instead of just show zeros, so thumbs up for this update. Although it works on Oxygen as well, i saw in the changelog it added native support for various builders but not Oxygen, so i recommend adding support for it too ðŸ™‚</div>
