== Short Description ==

Save your WordPress Dashboard from Notifications Bloat! Hide all those annoying and spammy notices from your WordPress Dashboard. You can also enable the option to store and view them all together under the Notifications Tab.

== Description ==

Warnings and notices can be helpful for developers as they notify them for debugging issues with their code. Though these notices can be sometimes informative, quite often they become frustrating, inconvenient and even spammy; especially since they are a way of promoting the additional services offered by some plugins. The end result is a bloated WordPress Dashboard where you have to spend a lot of time and energy to close all those nags in order to clear your WordPress website’s backend. Hide Dashboard Notifications allows you to easily turn off those nags and notifications & hide plugin updates. It also stores them under the Notifications Tab where you can review them later if you want to.

== Hide Dashboard Notifications Features ==

* Disables showing Plugin & Theme Notifications on your WordPress Dashboard.
* Disables showing WordPress Notifications from the WordPress Dashboard & Admin Bar.
* Lets you choose if you want to Hide the Dashboard Notifications for administrators(by default) or all backend user roles.
* Shows blocked notifications under the Notifications Tab.

== How it works: ==

As is the case with most WordPress sites the number of plugins installed is often quite big and so is the number of notifications popping up on your WordPress Dashboard. We are sure you are familiar with the chaos these can create while you work. As we understand how difficult it is for you to focus on such clutter, we have created the Hide Dashboard Notifications Plugin. It takes care of all plugin notifications for you and allows you to manage them successfully by silencing them so that you work undisturbed within a clear WordPress Dashboard.

Hide WordPress Dashboard Notifications is the easiest and most convenient way to deal with dashboard notifications. This way you can declutter your dashboard and stay focused on your work. All you need to do is install the Hide WordPress Dashboard Notifications plugin and choose the settings that suit your needs best. You can choose to hide the notifications coming from the installed plugins so that you get to focus on your work and get things done. 

You can even opt for hiding the WordPress update notices. As new releases of updates are rolled out frequently, you can choose to silence those notifications for a certain amount of time, or until you finish the issue you are working on. You also have the option of hiding the dashboard notices for only the Administrators of your website. The rest of the users of the WordPress website will still be able to receive the notices. 
 
These pop-ups and notices are not deleted. They are simply put on hold. Should you wish to go through them you will find them all perched under the notifications tab of the plugin. This way, you will be able to sort them out at your own convenience,  tackling them successfully.
