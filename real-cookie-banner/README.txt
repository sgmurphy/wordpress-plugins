= Does Real Cookie Banner find all cookies on my website automatically? =
Yes, Real Cookie Banner has a scanner that checks your website for used services. It recommends you from service templates and content blocker templates suitable configuration. It will also alert you to unknown services on your website that may require consent. For more information on how our service scanner works, [see our knowledge base](https://devowl.io/knowledge-base/real-cookie-banner-service-scanner/).

However, the service scanner is not a cookie scanner. A cookie scanner could, if at all, only find cookies, but not legally assess the processing of personal data. Moreover, it is highly complex to find all cookies and most so-called cookie scanners do not find all cookies. We have explained [in detail why this is so in our knowledge base](https://devowl.io/knowledge-base/real-cookie-banner-cookie-scanner-finds-cookies-automatically/
).

= What is the GDPR (also known as DSGVO, RGPD, RODO, AVG)? =

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), also referred to as GDPR, RGPD, RODO, or AVG in different regions, is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union in 2018. It aims to standardize data protection laws across all EU member states, safeguarding EU citizens' personal data while regulating how data is processed by organizations. The GDPR enhances individuals' control over their personal data, granting rights like access to data, correction, deletion, and the option to object to data processing under certain circumstances. It mandates transparency, consent, and accountability from organizations, making them responsible for ensuring data privacy and security.

Although the GDPR significantly impacts how cookies are used on websites, it does not directly regulate the use of cookies. The regulation of cookies falls under the ePrivacy Directive, often referred to as the "Cookie Law", which requires user consent for the storage of and access to cookies on their devices. However, since cookies can store personal data such as user preferences or behavior tracking information, the GDPR's consent and transparency principles come into play. In essence, while the ePrivacy Directive governs the use of cookies, the GDPR sets the broader framework for the protection of personal data, which indirectly influences how cookies are handled when they process personal data.

= What is the ePrivacy Directive (implemented in national law as TTDSG, LOPD-GDD, DTA, TLA, LEK, E-com Act)? =
Answer

The ePrivacy Directive, also known as the "Cookie Directive", is an EU directive focused on the protection of personal data in electronic communications. It requires companies and website operators within the EU to obtain users' consent before storing or accessing information on their devices, such as through cookies. It is the reason why most website in the EU have cookie plugins, also known as cookie consent dialogs or cookie banners. Member states have transposed the directive into their national laws, leading to various names for the legislation in different countries, like TTDSG in Germany, LOPD-GDD in Spain, DTA in Netherlands, TLA in Poland, LEK in Sweden, and the E-com Act in Norway.
