### MIME Types Management ###

Add or remove file types, allow or disallow uploading. The plugin incorporates a file type into media filters if you wish.


### Feels Native to WordPress ###

We spent hours to make Enhanced Media Library operates as though it were native WordPress functionality. All plugin features are incorporated into WordPress UI seamlessly.


### Developer-Friendly ###

* **Core hooks just work** for media taxonomies and media items
* **All taxonomies supported:** custom and code-registered
* **REST API supported** out of the box

* **Deactivation makes no harm to data:** all media items and taxonomies remain after deactivation


### Export / Import / Restore Plugin Settings ###

If you need to move your media library to another website you should export and import WordPress content with WordPress built-in export/import. But to make the Enhanced Media Library work on the new site with the same settings you are provided with the export/import feature.


### Multisite compatible ###

Network activate the plugin and choose which options will be available to your admins. In the PRO version, the license key should be activated once for the whole network.

### Incompatibility ###

Please notice that you use Enhanced Media Library with other plugins that add media categories, media folders, or manage MIME Types at your own risk.
