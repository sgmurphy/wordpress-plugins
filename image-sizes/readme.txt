Stop WordPress from generating unnecessary thumbnails while uploading an image!

== Description ==

When you upload an image using _Media Uploader_, WordPress generates multiple copies/thumbnails of that image. By default, WordPress generates 5 thumbnails-

- Thumbnail
- Medium
- Medium-large
- Large
- Scaled

But along with this, theme and plugin developers can register their own thumbnails. Although they may be on purpose, but sometimes they remain unused.

Think about it, **unnecessary additional images are eating up your server space** and **slowing down your site**!

Sounds like a problem?

This is where our plugin comes into the picture. Just install the plugin and choose which of the imaze sizes you want to prevent from generating.

- Works with any plugin and theme.
- WooCommerce compatible.
- Multisite compatible.
- Super easy to install and configure.
- It's free and always will be.
