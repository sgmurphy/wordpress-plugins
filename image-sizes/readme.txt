Here are some of the key features of the ThumbPress plugin for WordPress Image Management –

#### 🚀 Disable Thumbnails

When you upload an image using Media Uploader, WordPress generates multiple copies/thumbnails of that image. By default, WordPress generates 5 thumbnails:
– Thumbnail
– Medium
– Medium-large
– Large
– Scaled

Along with this, your themes and plugins add more thumbnails and most of these thumbnails remain unused.

The result? Unnecessary additional images eat up your server space and slow down your site!

This is where the Disable feature comes into the picture. Just install the plugin and choose which of the image sizes you want to prevent from generating.

#### 🚀 Regenerate Thumbnails

Regenerate thumbnails on your WordPress site at any moment, regardless of their sizes. No more worrying about lost thumbnails — our WordPress plugin guarantees swift restoration, keeping your site’s visual appeal flawless and consistent. Start now and rebuild thumbnails on your WordPress site.

#### 🚀 Social Media Thumbnails

ThumbPress enables you to assign unique thumbnails for various social media platforms, ensuring that an image intended for Facebook remains uncropped when shared on Twitter or LinkedIn. You can upload distinct thumbnails for each social media site.

#### 🚀 Image Upload Limit

Set a maximum limit for image upload size and resolution to ensure faster loading times. Our feature allows you to customize these parameters according to your website requirements and prevent oversized images from slowing down your site.

#### 🚀 Convert Images to WebP

In WordPress convert images to WebP in bulk or one by one without any effort. Convert JPG or PNG to WebP from the comfort of your favorite WordPress dashboard and upgrade your website’s performance without sacrificing image quality. This advanced function ensures your images remain crisp and clear while reducing file size compared to traditional formats. The image conversion to WebP format helps you in SEO and gets you better rankings as Google recommends this format.

#### 🚀 Disable Right Click on Image

Disable the right-click function on your website, a simple yet effective way to deter visitors from downloading or copying your images and thumbnails. It’s a preventive measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your digital assets and keeps your visuals exclusive to your site.

#### 🌟 Compress Images (The Easiest Image Compression Plugin on WordPress)

Optimize and have a blazing-fast website by using the WordPress image compression plugin ThumbPress. Our built-in WordPress image compression feature optimizes images to improve your site’s performance without losing visual quality. The plugin’s simple interface helps you compress WordPress effortlessly.

#### 🌟 Replace Image with New Version

Replace images with newer versions without changing their existing links. It ensures that the same image will show up properly if used elsewhere. It’s the perfect solution for maintaining visual relevance.

#### 🌟 Image Editor

We always try to upload the finest image to the site after all the editing stuff is done. But, sometimes, the previously uploaded images may require some brush-ups. In such cases, one option is to upload quite new images. The WordPress image editor feature of ThumbPress enables you to edit them right on your WordPress Dashboard. Try our simple and compact image editor tool today and bring perfection to your WordPress images.
