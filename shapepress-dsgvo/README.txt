WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.legalweb.io">legalweb.io</a> help you to fulfill the GDPR (DSGVO) compliance guidance (<a target="_blank" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/">GDPR</a>)

== Description ==

We recommend that all of our users and customers of the premium version switch to legal web cloud, as we are no longer adding any new features and functions to WP GDPR tools.

# **ALL-IN-ONE SOLUTION**

#### As a user of WP GDPR you have two simple tasks:

* Selection of the services used
* Filling of a few input fields

## WP GDPR does everything else:

* Creation of the cookie popup
* Creation of the cookie notice
* Control of services
* Control of embeddings
* Generation of the data protection information
* Creation of the imprint

# **TOP PRIORITY**

Our top priority is **compliance with the laws and the regulations of courts and of data protection authorities**. We do not offer options that are not legally or legally highly controversial.

**Why so strict?** Because our users have neither the desire nor the budget to lead complex procedures through all appeals, just to find out whether any cool feature is legally permissible or not.


# **LAWYER CREATED**

All legal texts were created by the law firm Marketingrecht.eu, which specializes in IT, internet and data protection law.

**Important note:** This plugin only supports you in fulfilling the guidelines for compliance with the GDPR. Installation is not enough - correct configuration of this plugin by a website administrator is required to achieve conformity. A 100% conformity only through the plugin cannot be guaranteed, as this depends on several other aspects. If you use our plugin and enable integrations with your custom snippets (Google Analytics, FB Pixel, Criteo,...), 3rd party scripts get loaded or remote ressources get called if/after your visitors opt-in for them. An valid statement in the privacy policy (to fulfill GDPR requirements) gets added automatically by this plugin. In some features automatically generated emails get sent to you or your customers. In these emails Google Fonts are used.

== Installation ==

Just install via WordPress plugin feature or upload zip and activate it.
