Add flexible content boxes with JSON-LD microdata output according to schema.org e.g. FAQPage, Recipe, Event, Course, LocalBusiness or JobPosting. It's your chance to beat the competition and for higher rank results – SEO for winners. #wpsc

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the download package
2. Upload structured-content to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Alternatively
1. upload the zip file from the Admin plugins page
2. then activate

== What does it do ==
With this plugin you can insert structured data elements multiple times in any post or page.

In simple dialogs, for example FAQ can be inserted. Because the the plugin renders the given information as JSON-LD according to schema.org, the bots of the search engines, like google, recognize this schema.
Nice option: you can decide if only the JSON-LD should be displayed in the source code or if the content should be preformatted and visible. Check or uncheck the "Render HTML" box to do this.

You can test whether the information has been labeled correctly with the [Markup Validator Tool](https://validator.schema.org/), for example.

The basic goal is that your content can be better understood by the algorithms of different search engines.
A special goal is, among other things, that your answers to questions from Google can be displayed as featured snippets in the SERPs (position 0) or extend your existing snippet in the SERPs.

**The plugin is optimized for the Gutenberg editor and future new structural elements will only be published as Gutenberg blocks. Actually most of the structured content elements also work with the TinyMCE!**

Currently the plugin offers seven structured data elements:
- FAQPage
- JobPosting
- LocalBusiness
- Recipe
- Person
- Event
- Course

Structure your content now and MAKE CONTENT GREAT AGAIN! #wpsc

== How to use it ==
Once the the plugin is installed and activated, you'll find a new icon in the titlebar of the WYSIWYG editor. Just click it, select your preferred structured content element you want to insert and a modal will open. Fill out the form, click the save button and your done.

If you use *Gutenberg* you'll find the new content blocks. Choose your preferred structured content element and fill out the form. If you want to answer more than one question, then simply add them by clicking on "Add one" *within* this Gutenberg block.

Alternatively use these shortcodes in your TinyMCE:
