Display Google reviews on your site and even show user images!  No address, no problem! Also works with Service Area Businesses and Products! 

== Description ==

Display your Google reviews on your WordPress site in under 2 minutes, with or without user uploaded images. It's a great way to boost customer confidence and social proof!

You work hard for your 5-star Google reviews, so now you can easily show them off on your WordPress site. Add a slider or responsive grid of your reviews to your widget areas or directly to your posts. Works with both physical address, service area businesses and even products.

Unlike other plugins, you can create as many Google review slider templates as you want and use them in different locations on your site. And you can easily control the look of your reviews by changing colors without any coding.

I built this plugin to make it as easy as possible for you to display your Google reviews. There are two different methods for downloading Google reviews, and all you need are some Google search terms or your place ID.

Increase sales and customer confidence by displaying Google reviews on your site today!

Here's a quick video demonstration of adding Google reviews in less than 2 minutes!

Unlock the Power of Google Reviews with Our WordPress Plugin

=Why show Google Reviews on your site?=

Countless successful businesses leverage Google reviews to entice new prospects and grow their customer base. If you're not showcasing Google reviews on your website, you're missing out on a free marketing opportunity.

Google reviews wield immense influence over consumer buying decisions. Many consumers rely on Google reviews to assess businesses and make informed purchase decisions. Google reviews are more trustworthy than reviews found on other platforms because they are linked to verified Google accounts.

To boost your business success, leverage Google by accumulating four and five-star reviews. The more positive reviews you have, the higher your business will rank in Google search results, which means more potential customers will consider your services.

Here are some tips for getting more Google reviews:

Provide excellent customer service.
Ask satisfied customers to leave a review.
Make it easy for customers to leave reviews by providing a direct link to your Google Business Profile.
Respond to all reviews, both positive and negative.
By following these tips, you can showcase your Google reviews and attract more customers to your business.


Feature List:

* Download your Google reviews and save them in your database.
* Create a really cool slider. Sort of like an image slider, but with your Google reviews.
