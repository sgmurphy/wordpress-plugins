Having an FAQ section or knowledge base on your site is essential to make sure you are not losing customers and to reduce your support load.

With this plugin and its simple UI, you can quickly create FAQs and add them to your site using the included blocks, patterns or shortcodes. It works with WordPress's built-in editor as well as third-party editors like **Elementor** and is translation-ready, with many already available [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-faqs/).

All this in an accordion layout that is automatically responsive and adapts to any site!

### Get Set Up in No Time!

When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through, which will help you create your FAQs and add them to a page.

### Google Optimized

The plugin includes full FAQPage and FAQ schema structured data markup, in LD+JSON format. So, when your page is indexed, Google will know itâ€™s an FAQ page and can list it accordingly in search results.

### Multiple Languages? We've got you covered!

Your FAQs are created using a post type. This means it works out of the box with language plugins like WPML, Loco Translate and Polylang. There are also many community translations already available [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-faqs/). And, of course, we include an up-to-date .pot for good measure, in case you like to create your own custom translations.

### Customization Options

We've included (in the free version!) advanced customization features that let you choose what elements show for each FAQ (e.g. categories, tags, author, date, etc.), set the order of your FAQs and categories, fine tune accordion behavior, add your own custom CSS and more!

### Statistics

FAQ statistics and view counts are automatically enabled, so you can easily keep track of which questions are the most popular.

### Comments

We've included the ability for you to enable comments on FAQs, giving you a platform to communicate with your users/customers and help improve not only your knowledge base, but your overall product or service. This makes use of WordPress's built-in comment engine, which means seamless integration and you can use WordPress's comment and moderation settings to fine tune the experience.
