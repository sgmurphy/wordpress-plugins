## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Do I Reset ASE Settings / Configuration?

If for whatever reason you need to remove ASE and reset the settings / configuration, please follow these steps:

1. Access your website via FTP and delete ASE plugin folder at /wp-content/plugins/admin-site-enhancements/
2. Login to your site via the default URL, /wp-admin/ or /wp-login.php
3. Install [SQL Buddy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sql-buddy/) plugin, open it, and click on the wp_options table
4. Use the small filter icon at the top of wp_options table rows, and filter for “option_name” => “contains” => “admin_site_enhancements”. You should get 3 options . Click on each one and hit the “Delete” icon in the bottom-right corner.
5. Re-install and re-configure ASE as needed.

You can skip step 1 and 2 if you still have access to your wp-admin dashboard.
