When this plugin is installed, you’ll be able to sign up for the [SendWP](https://sendwp.com/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=sendwp) service from the SendWP menu page. Once you’re signed up, all your WordPress emails will be routed through sendwp.com. We know that sending all your email through a third-party can be scary, so please can check out our privacy policy and terms and conditions.
