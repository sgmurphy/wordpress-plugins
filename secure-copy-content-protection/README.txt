== Protection ==

* In the part of protection here comes a watermark, but nowadays modern thieves can easily erase it. That is why you should turn off no right click and drag and drop and again you will have a copy-protected text and image.
* We approve that it is trustworthy. For instance, if the client sees the same content in another site he may think that the plagiarism is yours. But it is a big infringement of copyright which you can protect. Here again, comes for the help the plugin which will avoid theft of copyright. Use copyright symbols in the plugin and there will not be an outflow of information.
* The next vital question is: Can a website be copyrighted and the answer will be No. You will not meet any infringement with the plugin. There is a law of international copyright and plugin will be like a confirmation of that law.
* The plugin can help to protect your personal files. Such as personal information. For instance, if you are a blogger, journalist or you work in the sphere of film, sport and in any field that wants personal information protection in that case the plugin is just for you. You just disable copy shortcut keys, disable inspect elements and your personal information will not be in hands of thieves. Which is really very disgusting. So that is why you just install the plugin in a few seconds and will have a copyrighted blog.

So the main reason why to choose the plugin. It is easy to use, easy to install and ensures your fire protection. To protect your personal information and avoid any kinds of plagiarism or web scraping, just install the plugin. And it is vital to repeat that you will get a copyright infringement protection. And this plugin will be the patent for your personal information. If there exists the law of infringement protection then without any doubt this plugin is the confirmation of that law.

== Block content with a password: (Content Locker) ==

This field is designed to protect parts of your content. Restrict content with a password by using a simple shortcode. You can create multiple shortcodes and write a password for each. Then you just need to copy the shortcode, go to posts/pages and edit an already created post or add a new one. Put your content between the parts of the shortcode, in the place where is written "Content" ([ays_block id='1'] Content [/ays_block]).

* Shortcode - a new shortcode is created automatically after pressing "Add new" button.

* Password - write the password that a user has to fill in to be able to see the content. The number in the orange square shows the number of users who entered the password to see the content.

* Only for - choose a user role and enable a certain user to see the content without entering the password. The number in the orange square shows the number of times the content was viewed by a user role. 

* Schedule - there is a possibility to show the restricted content for a certain period of time and after that it will be disappeared from the page. 


== Subscribe to view: (Gated Content) ==

This field enables you to **hide the content** of any part of your post and show only when the user writes his/her email address.
Each time when a new user arrives at your website, scrolls down and comes across the hidden content,
it will require the email address to continue reading.
Do you want to know your website visitors? This feature will perfectly fulfill your need. It is an amazing tool for gathering leads.
It will allow you to implement a customer-centric strategy on your website by segmenting and remarketing your leads.
Moreover, its attention-capturing appearance will also help to increase user engagement and arouse curiosity.
