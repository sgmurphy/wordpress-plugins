= EXTENDED RESPONSIVE OPTIONS =
Mobile traffic is even more than desktop nowadays, and Greenshift has everything to make your mobile web design better. It provides 4 custom breakpoints, preview mode and possibility to add different values per each resolution. All blocks have special optimized mobile layouts. Also, you can shift your regular columned design to smart scroll on mobiles to generate Application-style design.

= DYNAMIC LOADING =
We understand that you may want to keep your current page editor, but in the same time you want to use some features from Greenshift. For this purpose, we added possibility to convert blocks and pages to shortcode. You can use them directly in your plugin or custom pages. And even more, we added possibility to load blocks dynamically when they are in view, or by click/hover. This can save page perfomance on heavy pages.

= Highest web vitals score =
We believe that Greenshift is most optimized plugin for web vitals. It's because plugin uses unique conditional asset loading. All blocks are divided on style chunks which are loaded only when you use them on page. All dynamic libraries have no jquery dependencies. All styles are loaded inline in head section of page to prevent CLS and incompatibilities with cache plugins. Reusable blocks, Widget and Template environments are supported. 

= TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH GREENSHIFT ADDONS =
All our core features are free and will be free always. We don't sell any premium versions and don't limit functionality. In the same time, you may be interesting in extra blocks depending on your type of site. Check full list of addon's [blocks for wordpress](https://greenshiftwp.com/block-gallery/) 

= ANIMATION ADDON =
You can add any custom animation in core version, but Animation addon will give you more options based on popular GSAP library. Custom parallaxes, different triggers for animations (scroll, hover, click, stagger, batch), controll interpolation with scroll, Pin blocks while scroll, make Smooth flip between states, use Smart Lottie loader, add animated blobs, reveals, mouse interactions, animation chains and connections, text and svg animations, image sequences and video loaders. Use Rive block to add Rive scenes and our special API to connect dynamic site values and Rive. 

= QUERY ADDON =
Query addon is usefull if you want to extend dynamic functionality. It has a lot of ready patterns for query loop block, you can customize and extend each of them with special Meta getter block (use to get and show any values from custom field, ACF, ToolSet or taxonomy meta), wishlist block, thumbs and hot counter. Visibility block allows you to show/hide content based on different filters (category, tags, taxonomy, custom field value, user roles, detection of current category). Advanced listing builder helps you to build directory listings. Query Builder allows you to build any kind of design for CPT loops and carousels.

= SEO AND MARKETING ADDON =
We have very long 10 year story of developing different tools for affiliate, review, comparison sites. In coordination with best affiliate professionals and bloggers, we built set of special, highly conversion blocks to earn more profit from your sites. Link parser helpers, offer blocks, comparison and versus tables, listings, score and review boxes, woocommerce boxes. All blocks have special mobile layouts.
