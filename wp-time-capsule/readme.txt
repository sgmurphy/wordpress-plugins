Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule is an automated incremental backup plugin that backs up your website changes as per your schedule to Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3, Wasabi and Backblaze B2 Cloud.

== Description ==

[WP Time Capsule](https://wptimecapsule.com/ "Incremental Backup for WordPress") was created to ensure peace of mind with WP updates and put the fun back into WordPress. It uses the cloud apps' native file versioning system to detect  changes and backs up just the changed files and db entries to your account.

You need to sign up for an account on our website https://service.wptimecapsule.com to get a 30 days full featured trial.

<br> 
**With WP Time Capsule you can**<br>
<br>
**Backup in real-time**
You can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. <br>
<br>
**Staging**
With a single click staging it's a breeze to test any change you are planning to do on your site. Test your updates on staging with a single click<br>
<br>
**Auto backup and update**
We automatically backup before each update, if an update causes any undesired change. You are a click away from restoring.<br>
<br>
**Encrypted DB backups & GDPR Compatible**
You can encrypt your DB backups to add an extra layer of security and makes your backup GDPR compatible. <br>
<br>
**Clone/Migrate**
You can now use the WPTC backup to clone or migrate your site to a new location at ease.<br>
<br>

**How is WP Time Capsule different than other backup plugins?**
<br>
WPTC is unique in 4 ways -<br>
1. It backs up and restores only the changed files & DB and not the entire site every time.<br>
2. The files & DB are stored in your cloud storage app - Amazon S3, Wasabi, Backblaze, Dropbox or Google Drive.
3. We have used the cloud apps' native file versioning system to detect changes and maintain file versions. So backups and restores are as reliable as they get.
4. Most importantly, you can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. 
<br><br>
**How does it work?**
<br>
1. Sign up an account on our website https://wptimecapsule.com and you will get a 30 days full featured trial.<br>
2. Install the plugin and login with your wptimecapsule.com account.<br>
3. Next, connect the cloud app where you want to store the backup files. You can use Amazon S3, Wasabi, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br>
4. Once you connect the cloud app, we will automatically begin backing up your complete website to your cloud app account.<br><br>
After the first full backup is taken, you can schedule a time for WPTC to backup your websites. We will take care of your backups from here on.
This being done you will officially be *disaster-ready*. :)
<br><br>
**Backup**: Looks for files & DB changes since the last backup and uploads only the changes. The data is then stored securely in your cloud app account.
<br>
**Restore**: Checks revision history and displays the same. You can restore the site to any point in time or restore specific files & DB.
<br><br>
**How is it better?**<br>
BACKUP METHOD<br>
Traditionally - Backups are compressed and zipped. The Bad: Heavy server resource consumption.<br>
WPTC - No zipping. Changed files are directly dropped into your cloud account. The Good: ***Uses considerably less server resources***
<br><br>
BACKUP FILE<br>
Traditionally - Multiple zip files are created every time you backup. The Bad: Precious storage space is wasted.<br>
WPTC - Backs up incrementally. No multiple copies of files. The Good: ***Uses far less disk space***
<br><br>
RESTORE<br>
Traditionally - Unzip backup and restore the whole site. The Bad: Consumes time and server resource.<br>
WPTC - Restores only selected files. The Good: ***Faster restore and you can restore even if you don't have access to your site or plugin.***
