The "Latest Post Shortcode" allows you to create a dynamic content selection from your posts by combining, limiting, and filtering what you need.

== Description ==
The "Latest Post Shortcode" helps you display a list or grid of the posts or pages in a page/sidebar, without having to code or know PHP. The output parameters are extremely flexible, allowing you to choose the way your selected content will be displayed. You can embed as many shortcodes in a page as you need, each shortcode configured differently. The shortcode for displaying the latest posts is `[latest-selected-content]` and can be generated very easily, the plugin will add a block or a shortcode button in the editor area.

You can write your own "read more" replacement, choose whether to show/hide featured images, you can even sort the items by several options, and paginate the output (also AJAX pagination). This plugin works with any modern theme. When used with WordPress >= 5.0 + Gutenberg, the plugin shortcode can be configured from the LPS block or any Classic block, using the plugin button. The plugin can be used with Elementor page builder.

= Usage example =
Example of a simple grid with 4 cards per row, with AJAX pagination:
`[latest-selected-content ver="2" perpage="4" showpages="4" display="title,date,excerpt-small" titletag="h3" chrlimit="120" more="â€¦" url="yes" linktext="Read more" image="thumbnail" image_placeholder="auto" elements="25" image_opacity="0.3" css="four-columns as-overlay content-end pagination-space-between light tall" type="post" status="publish" orderby="dateD" show_extra="ajax_pagination,pagination_all,trim,date_diff,category,hide_uncategorized_category,oneterm_category,light_spinner"]`

Example of a simple grid with 4 cards (2 per row), filtered by a category (sample term):
`[latest-selected-content ver="2" limit="4" display="title,content-small" titletag="h3" chrlimit="50" image="full" image_placeholder="auto" elements="0" css="two-columns as-column has-shadow content-center" type="post" taxonomy="category" term="sample" orderby="dateA"]`

Starting with version 8.0.0, the plugin has a new UI and some new cool features. With this version, the output of the shortcode can be configured also as a slider, with responsive and different modes options. In this way, if you previously used the Latest Post Shortcode Extension, this is no longer needed, the plugin handles it all by itself.

Starting with version 7.0.0, the plugin implements new hooks that allow for defining and managing your custom output, through your theme or your plugins. Check more hook details and code samples at https://iuliacazan.ro/latest-post-shortcode/.
