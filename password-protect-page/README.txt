Password protect WordPress pages and posts by user roles or with multiple passwords; protect your entire website with a single password.

== Description ==

Password Protect WordPress (PPWP) plugin offers a powerful and **all-in-one solution** to secure your website with passwords.

Whether you want to password protect WordPress categories, WooCommerce products, a few posts, or your entire website, PPWP plugin will help you do so with ease.

This plugin does not protect images or uploaded files so if you attach the media files to the protected pages or posts, they are still accessible to anyone with the link. Use [Prevent Direct Access (PDA) Gold](https://preventdirectaccess.com/features/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=pda-gold-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) to block their direct file URL access.

Please note that the passwords will be stored in the post meta and this plugin will set a cookie to allow access to the protected pages or posts.

= An Inside Look at Password Protect WordPress - PPWP Pro =

= Password Protected Features =
The Lite version of Password Protect WordPress (PPWP) plugin offers the following features:

== Protect WordPress Pages & Posts with Unlimited Passwords ==
The plugin extends WordPress built-in password protection feature and allows you to set multiple passwords per Page and Post. What's more, you can protect the content with just a single click. Once protected, a random password will be automatically generated for you.

= Password Protect WordPress Pages & Posts by User Roles =
There is an option allowing you to password protect your WordPress Pages & Posts by user roles. In other words, you can set different passwords for different user roles, e.g. one for subscribers and one for editors.

= Prevent Password Abuse with reCAPTCHA =
Stop password abuse and spam by bots and automated software with Google reCAPTCHA v2 or v3. Real users will be able to access protected content with ease as usual.

= Unlock Password Protected Content without Page Refresh =
[Use Ajax to display protected content](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/unlock-password-protected-content-without-page-refresh/??utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=ajax-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) without having to reload the entire page. It will help improve user experience and avoid server caching after users enter their password.

== Password Protect WordPress Categories ==
Instead of creating an individual password for each post, you can protect all posts under one or multiple categories at once. Once users unlock a post successfully, they will be able to access the rest of the content automatically.

== Password Protect Entire WordPress Site ==
You can [password protect the whole WordPress site](https://passwordprotectwp.com/features/password-protect-entire-wordpress-site/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=sitewide-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) with a single password. All your website content including pages, posts, and other custom post types (but not media files) are locked as well.

== Partial Content Protection ==
Partial Content Protection feature allows you to [password protect certain sections](https://passwordprotectwp.com/features/password-protect-partial-content/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=free-pcp-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) of a page or post instead of hiding the entire content under a password form. This is useful when you want to create a teaser of premium content that encourages visitors to register/sign up to unlock the entire post.

= Section Protection =
Section Protection takes PCP to the next level. The feature enables you to add [password-protected sections](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/section-protection/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=section-protection-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) even on custom post types &  templates created by top page builders such as Elementor and Divi.

= Show/Hide Premium Content at a Specific Time =

You can also choose when to publish the secure content to users. For example, they’re allowed to see the content without having to enter passwords from XXX to XXX using the following shortcode attributes.

`
[ppwp passwords=123 on="2020/10/20 14:00:00" off="2020/10/30 14:00:00"] Your protected section will be shown automatically from 2 pm October 20, 2020 to 2 pm October 30, 2020[/ppwp]
`

== Integrate with Page Builders ==
Instead of using our shortcode to protect part of content, you can use our built-in module for the top page builders including:

* Elementor
* Beaver Builder
* WPBakery Page Builder*
* Divi Builder*

*Supported; built-in UI block to be released soon.

These built-in modules allow you to set passwords, whitelisted roles, customize password forms, and so on via our friendly User Interface. You no longer have to deal with the complex shortcode attributes.

What's more, with PPWP Pro, you can even [protect the entire Elementor's templates](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/password-protect-partial-content-elementor/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=pro-elementor-guide-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free), Beaver Builder's rows, columns, and page templates as well as limiting and tracking password usage.

== Master Passwords ==
When there are many password protected posts on your website, it becomes difficult and time-consuming to create or manage passwords for each content. That’s when master passwords come in handy.

Users will be able to [unlock all protected posts at once](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/master-passwords-unlock-all-protected-content/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=master-pwd-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free) with just one master password.

Please note that this feature **does not** password protect all posts automatically. It simply allows you to use master passwords to unlock those that you’ve already password protected. Original passwords attached to each post will still be working, together with these master passwords.

The master passwords feature also comes with an easy-to-use interface allowing you to create unlimited master passwords simultaneously and manage all of them in one place. You will have full control to (de)activate, delete passwords as well as restrict usage passwords by usage, time, and user role.

== Customize Password Form & Messages with WordPress Customizer ==
Customize all your password forms, i.e. the sitewide login form, single and partial content protection (PCP) password form, via WordPress Customizer.

You’re allowed to remove or change our default logo to your own in the sitewide login form. You can also change the color, background and design of the form to match your theme’s color scheme.

[Besides the default login page](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/customize-sitewide-login-page/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=customize-sitewide-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free), you can now select one from our pre-designed themes that suits your site best.

As for [single password form](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/customize-password-form-wordpress-customizer/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=customize-pcp-link&utm_campaign=ppwp-free), you're able to change the WordPress default error message as well as password form instructions, namely headline, descriptions, password input placeholder, and button text.

The button and text's font-size, color, and background can also be customized through a friendly WYSIWYG HTML Editor.


== Hide Password Protected Content ==
By default, your password protected content will still show up on various pages such as home and category page once published.

This feature allows you to control the visibility of your protected post types in different views:

* Hide posts from Recent Posts widgets
* Hide posts from Next & Previous link on the single post
* Hide posts on search results
* Hide posts from Yoast SEO Google XML Sitemaps, and RSS
* Hide posts on Frontpage, Author, and Archive pages including tag and category page
* Protected pages hidden from search results, home page & everywhere they're listed

Even though the posts are hidden, those who know the URL will still have access to the pages (but not the protected content).

= Show Password Protected Content in RSS Feeds =
Even though you choose to show password protected content in RSS, a password form will display instead of its actual content by default. With PPWP plugin, you're able to show all protected content in RSS feeds. There is also an option to make your RSS feeds public even if your site is hidden.

= Show Password Protected Post Excerpts =
Many WordPress themes hide the post excerpt and featured image of password protected content by default. Enable this option to show excerpts of your password protect posts.

= Password's Cookies Expiration =
By default, users won't have to re-enter passwords to access a protected page or post until its cookies expire. You can change the default cookie expiration time on the plugin settings page to whatever suits your use case. Or else, choose session cookies which will be removed automatically whenever users close their browser. As a result, users have to re-enter password when opening the browser again.
