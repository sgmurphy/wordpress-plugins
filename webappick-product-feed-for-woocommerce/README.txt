== Upgrade Notice ==
= 6.0.0 =
This is a major release. Please update to version 6.0.0. Lots of issues were solved and a new UX/UI was added. Also, we frequently update the CTX feed plugin as our users need it. If any problem occurs while updating then reactivate the plugin. It's a good practice to make a backup of your database before updating.
