= Is my data safe? Is Happyforms HIPAA compliant? =

Our competitors claim to be HIPAA compliant, but that‚Äôs misleading. Those dodgy buggers! Why have a compliant form if your site‚Äôs server, connected services and chosen inbox aren‚Äôt?

To keep things simple, we say to disable Happyforms from saving submissions and instead point replies to an email address hosted by an end-to-end encrypted email service like ProtonMail.

It‚Äôs easier than it sounds. Promise. Hit us up if you have questions.

Yep! We always recommend building forms on a desktop, but you can fill out a form anywhere ‚Äî mobile, tablet and desktop.

Yep! Happyforms directly connects with reCaptcha, Google Analytics, ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, Mailchimp, MailerLite, MailPoet, SendFox, SendGrid, Sendinblue, Stripe, PayPal, Zapier, Integrately and Integromat.
