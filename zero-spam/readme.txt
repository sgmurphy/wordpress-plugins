2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen (*Plugins > Installed Plugins*).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Zero Spam for WordPress block user IPs? =

*Not on its own.* Zero Spam for WordPress does not automatically block IP addresses. If a visitor is blocked, it could be due to manual blocking by the site admin or their presence in IP blacklists such as [Stop Forum Spam](https://www.stopforumspam.com/), [Project Honeypot](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/), or the [Zero Spam](https://www.zerospam.org).

In the event that a legitimate user is blocked, refer to the Log (Admin > Dashboard > Zero Spam > Log) for further details on the reason behind the block. You have the flexibility to adjust the strictness of the 3rd-party blacklist checks or disable them if your users are prone to being flagged as spam or malicious.

= Does Zero Spam for WordPress check Jetpack comments? =

**No, it doesn't.** Zero Spam for WordPress does not have integration with Jetpack. If you have any inquiries regarding this, please refer to [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments) for more details.

= How do I boost performance of Zero Spam for WordPress? =

**Enable caching for optimal performance.** Enabling caching is highly recommended as it helps prevent repetitive calls to third-party APIs and access checks during each page visit.

To further optimize performance, you can adjust the cache and API timeout settings in the admin panel based on your server specifications and specific requirements.

= Does Zero Spam support WP-CLI commands? =

* `wp zerospam autoconfigure` &mdash; Auto-configures with recommended settings.
* `wp zerospam settings` &mdash; Displays all plugin settings.
* `wp zerospam set --[SETTING_KEY]=[VALUE]` &mdash; Updates a plugin setting.

= Are you getting a `ftp_fget` PHP warning? =

Some hosts have issues with they way they access files. If you're seeing a `ftp_fget` PHP notice, setting the `FS_METHOD` constant to `direct` in `wp-config.php` above the line `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy Pressing. */` should solve the problem:

`define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');`

If hosting with Pantheon, see their [known issues page](https://pantheon.io/docs/plugins-known-issues#define-fs_method) for more information and what to do to resolve it with their `$_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']` variable check.

= Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/zero-spam)
