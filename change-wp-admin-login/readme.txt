== Key Features Our Users 🤍 About All In One Login ==

The All in One Login plugin includes all the essential features that ensure the best WordPress Login Security and customization.

Let's explore some of its key features: 👇

**✔️ Change WP-Admin URL**

The default WP-Admin URL is an easy target for hackers, which means your WordPress login page is always vulnerable to attacks.

But don't worry❗ 

All in One Login lets you change the WP-Admin URL, making it difficult for attackers to locate your login page. This simple change significantly improves your WordPress Admin Login Security and protects your site from unauthorized access attempts.

**✔️ WordPress Login Customization [Free + Pro]**

Personalize your WordPress login page with extensive customization options. Use pre-built templates, change the background image, add your logo, and even use custom CSS for WP-Admin.

A customized login page not only enhances your brand but also provides a unique and engaging user experience.

**✔️ Ban User/IP Address [Pro]**

Want to prevent certain users from accessing your WordPress login page❓

Using All in One Login, you can instantly block specific users or IP addresses with just a few clicks. This way, you can prevent unauthorized access and keep your WordPress login page safe from hackers.

**✔️ Google reCAPTCHA**

Prevent your WordPress login page from spam and bots.

Integrate Google reCAPTCHA to protect against unauthorized logins. You can choose between reCAPTCHA v2 or v3 and adjust the settings accordingly.

Google reCAPTCHA helps distinguish between human users and bots, effectively reducing spam and automated login attempts. Thus, it enhances the security and integrity of your WordPress login page.

**✔️ App-Based 2FA [Pro]**

Step up your WordPress login security with App-Based 2FA.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security. All in One Login supports app-based 2FA using Google Authenticator, FreeOTP, or Authy. By requiring a time-based one-time password (TOTP) alongside the usual login credentials, you make sure only authorized users can access your WP Admin.

Therefore, this feature greatly improves your WordPress Login Security, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized users to break in.

**✔️ Temp Access URL [Pro]**

Need to provide temporary access to specific users❔

All in One Login allows you to generate a Temp Access URL for designated users. This feature is perfect for granting short-term access without compromising security. You can set the maximum number of visits and toggle 2FA for each temporary URL.

With Temp Access URLs, you maintain control over temporary user access, which ensures that they can no longer log in once their access period expires.

**✔️ Limit Login Attempts**

Protect your WordPress login page against a Brute-force attack.

AIO Login lets you limit failed login attempts. Lock out users after a specified number of failed attempts to protect your WP Admin from brute force attacks. This prevents attackers from continuously guessing passwords and protects your WP Admin from unauthorized access.


**✔️ Whitelist IP Addresses [Pro]**

If you only want to allow login access to trusted IPs, then AIO Login Pro is for you❗

By allowing only trusted IP addresses to access your login page, you can prevent unauthorized users from even attempting to log in. This adds an additional layer of security to your WordPress Admin Login, making sure that only users from approved IP addresses can gain entry.
