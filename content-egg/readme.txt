* **Feed Modules**: Work with any CSV or XML product feeds.
* **Offer Module**: Manually add any products.
* **Affiliate Egg Integration**: Use custom Affiliate Egg parsers for additional support.

* **NoAPI Module**: Designed for beginners, this module allows you to make your first 3 sales and gain API access.

= Can I create custom output templates? =

Yes, you can create custom templates. Here are two ways to do it:

1. **Manual Customization**: You'll need skills in PHP, HTML, and CSS. The default templates use the Bootstrap CSS framework.
2. **AI Assistance**: Use a specially trained ChatGPT to create a custom template. Simply describe what you need, and the AI will generate the code for you instantly.

= What's the difference between Content Egg and Affiliate Egg? =

* **Content Egg**: Operates through official product APIs and offers numerous modules for various affiliate networks. Ideal for product review blogs, price comparison websites, and daily deals websites.
