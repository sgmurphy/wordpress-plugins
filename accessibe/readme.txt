Open your website to the world!

Navigating the internet is a daily challenge for 15% of the world’s population. That’s the percentage of people with disabilities in the world today, and they experience limitations when navigating your website. accessiBe’s solution coupled with our WordPress accessibility plugin enables a wide array of people with disabilities to use your website effectively, boosting your market reach.

To make websites accessible, accessWidget service utilizes two applications that run together. The AI-powered background process handles optimizations for the more complex requirements like screen-reader and keyboard navigation adjustments, while the accessibility interface handles UI and design-related adjustments.

How the AI-Powered process works:

Using contextual understanding and image recognition, accessWidget’s AI scans and analyzes websites to learn what elements and functionality they include, adjusting them to your users’ screen-readers. Automatic screen-reader adjustments include:
 - Alt Tags
 - State Controls
 - ARIA Attributes
 - Icons & Buttons
 - Roles & Landmarks
 - Forms & Validations

accessWidget’s AI learns and understands the structures and behaviors of your website’s elements on-the-fly, adding keyboard-only functionality to each of them. Automatic keyboard navigation adjustments include:
 - Dropdowns
 - Menus
 - Popups
 - Forms
 - Skip Links
 - Buttons

**An accessibility interface for customized accessibility**
accessWidget’s interface provides an optimal online experience tailored to every user’s individual needs. There’s a range of seamless customization options that support multiple UI and design adjustments from content to display and more.

> “Many of our clients were being hit with frivolous lawsuits. accessiBe solved many of these.”
> **Joe P, G2 Crowd**

**How does accessiBe work? Automatically**

After installing the accessiBe plugin and registering for an account on our site (service), you’ll automatically enable around-the-clock, 24/7 compliance. accessWidget’s AI technology automatically scans for new and revised content every 24 hours.

> “accessiBe is an exceptional solution that helps our clients drive more revenue and achieve compliance with minimum costs and efforts.”
> **Tara, Director of Client Services at SellSide Media**

**Developed Side-By-Side with People with Disabilities**

accessWidget’s first stable version took 18 months of daily development to collaborate with people with disabilities that continue today. Blind people, motor and visually impaired people, people with epilepsy, and others are vital parts of our research & development.
> “Developing accessiBe side-by-side with the people who are using it daily is the secret sauce to our success.”
