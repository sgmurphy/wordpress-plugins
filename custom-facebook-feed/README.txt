*"The perfect Facebook plugin with amazing support! What else do you want? Get it!"* - [JoeJeffries](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/you-dont-already-have-this?facebook)

*"I honestly cannot recommend this Facebook plugin enough. The plugin itself is gorgeous and super customizable, and if you run into trouble...support will get you out of it. Five Stars across the board."* - [pamsavoybarnett](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/love-this-plugin-w-awesome-support?facebook)

**Please note:** This free Facebook plugin allows you to display text and links from Facebook posts. To display **photos, videos, comments,** and more, we offer a Pro version of the plugin.  See the Pro Version section below for more information.

### Features
**NEW: Now Supports Facebook oEmbeds**
With WordPress removing support for Facebook oEmbeds, the plugin will now automatically power any Facebook embeds on your site preventing them from breaking. No developer app required.

**Super Simple to Set Up**
One of our main priorities has always been to make our Facebook plugin as easy as possible to setup and use. Get up and running in less than 1 minute with our signature quick setup - no Facebook Developer App required.

**Display Feeds from Your Facebook Page**
Use the plugin to display Facebook feeds from a page that you are an admin of.

**Completely Customizable**
By default the feed will adopt the styles of your WordPress theme, but your feeds can be completely customized to look however you like using our visual feed customizer - with tons of options to customize every part of your posts and feed.

**Elementor and Divi Ready**
Custom Facebook Feeds has a built-in Elementor and Divi block for easy page building. Simply launch your Elementor or Divi builder and find the related Custom Facebook Feed block in the sidebar like any other block.

**SEO Friendly**
The feed content is crawlable by search engines adding SEO value to your site, while other Facebook plugins embed the feed using iframes which are not crawlable.

**GDPR Compliant**
Automatically integrates with many of the popular GDPR cookie consent plugins and includes a 1-click easy GDPR setting.

**Responsive and Mobile Optimized**
Feed layouts look great on any screen size and in any container width.

**Unlimited Feeds from Unlimited Different Pages**
We don't limit how many Facebook feeds you can display on your site. Just use the shortcode to embed as many feeds as you like into pages, posts or widgets anywhere on your site.

**Built for Speed**
Built-in caching means that your Facebook feeds load lightning fast. Set your own caching time - check for new Facebook posts every few seconds, minutes, hours or days. You decide.

**Like Box Widget and Visual Header**
Include the official Facebook Like Box widget at the top or bottom of your Facebook feed and display a beautiful visual header with your Facebook page or cover photo, profile picture, bio, and number of likes.

**So Much More**
Show and hide certain parts of each Facebook post, choose whose posts to show in the feed, customize colors, font sizes and styles, the number of Facebook posts to display, set max text lengths, translate text, custom CSS, and much, much more.

### Pro Version (Custom Facebook Feed Pro)

In order to maintain the free version of the Custom Facebook Feed plugin on an ongoing basis, and to provide quick and effective support for free, we offer a Pro version of the plugin. Custom Facebook Feed Pro allows you to display photos, videos, the number of likes, shares, reactions and comments for each Facebook post, choose from multiple layout options, filter Facebook posts by type or #hashtag/string, load more Facebook posts into your feed, and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For a full list of FAQs and help with troubleshooting please visit the **[FAQ & Troubleshooting](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/faq/)** section of the Smash Balloon website

= Are there any limitations on which Facebook page feeds I can display? =

The Facebook feed you're trying to display has to be from a publicly accessible page. This means that you can't display the feed from your own personal Facebook profile. This is to do with Facebook's privacy policies. You can't display a non-public page publicly.

If your Facebook page has any restrictions on it (age, for example) then it means that people have to be signed into Facebook in order to view your page. This isn't desirable for most pages as it means that it isn't accessible by people who don't have a Facebook account and that your Facebook page can't be crawled and indexed by search engines.

An easy way to determine whether your Facebook page is set to public is to sign out of your Facebook account and try to visit your page. If Facebook forces you to sign in to view your page then it isn't public. You can change your page to public in your page settings simply by removing any age or location restrictions you have on it ([screenshot](https://smashballoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/facebook-page-restrictions.png)), which will then allow the plugin to access and display your feed.

= Can I display feeds from multiple Facebook pages? =

Yep! Create as many feeds as you like from different pages. Just click "Add New" to create a new feed and then embed it anywhere on your site.

= Can I display feeds from a Facebook Group? =

As of April of 2024 the plugin is no longer able to display posts from a Facebook group. This is due to changes on Facebook's end.

= Can I display the feed from a personal profile? =

Due to Facebook's privacy policy you're not able to use the plugin to display all of your posts from a personal profile, only from a public page, as posts from a personal profile are protected for privacy reasons. You may have limited success in displaying certain posts from a personal profile but most posts are not able to be displayed.

If you're using the profile to represent a business, organization, product, public figure or the like, then we'd advise converting your profile to a page per [Facebook's recommendation](http://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/), as there are many advantages to using pages over profiles.

Once you've done so, the plugin will be able to retrieve and display all of your posts.

= Does the plugin work with Facebook oEmbeds? =

In version 2.5, support was added to allow the plugin to power your oEmbeds as official support for these is no longer available in WordPress core. Just connect your account on the oEmbeds settings page inside the plugin and the plugin will power all Facebook embeds on your site, old and new. No developer app or account required.

= Can I show photos and videos in my feed? =

This free plugin only allows you to display text from your Facebook posts. To display photos and videos in your feed you would need to upgrade to the Pro version of the plugin. Try out a demo of the Pro version on the [Custom Facebook Feed website](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/demo/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=media "Custom Facebook Feed Demo"), and find out more about the Pro version [here](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=pro "Custom Facebook Feed Pro"). [Click here](https://smashballoon.com/differences-between-the-free-version-and-pro-version-of-the-custom-facebook-feed-plugin/ "Differences between free and Pro version of Custom Facebook Feed plugin") for a full list of all differences between the free version and Pro version.

= Can I show the comments, shares and likes associated with each post? =

This is a feature of the [Pro version of the plugin](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=comments "Custom Facebook Feed Pro"). To display comments, shares and likes you would need to upgrade from the free version to the Pro version.

= Is the content of my Custom Facebook Feed crawlable by search engines? =

It sure is. Unlike other plugins which use iframes to embed your feed into your page once it's loaded, the Custom Facebook Feed uses PHP to embed your Facebook feed content directly into your page. This adds dynamic, search engine crawlable content to your site.

= How do I embed the Custom Facebook Feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode "WordPress.org do_shortcode reference") function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[custom-facebook-feed]'); ?>`.

= My feed posts are not showing up, or all I can see is the Facebook Like box but no posts =

Please refer to [this FAQ](https://smashballoon.com/facebook-feed-doesnt-show-can-see-like-box-posts-gives/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=errors "My posts are not showing up, or all I can see is the Facebook Like box but no posts") for potential solutions on how to resolve this issue.

= Changing the font in your feed and using Google Fonts =

Please refer to [this FAQ](https://smashballoon.com/changing-the-font-in-your-facebook-feed-using-google-fonts/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=fonts "Changing the font in your Facebook feed and using Google Fonts") for directions on how to use Google fonts in your Facebook posts.

= Can I display my posts horizontally or in multiple columns? =

Please refer to [this FAQ](https://smashballoon.com/can-display-facebook-post-horizontally-multiple-columns/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=horizontal "Can I display my Facebook posts horizontally or in multiple columns?") for directions on how to display your Facebook posts in multiple columns.

= My feed appears to have stopped updating / working =

If your Facebook feed doesn't appear to be showing the most recent posts then the most likely explanation is that the recent posts in your feed may be shared from a user's personal profile. Facebook's privacy policy doesn't allow posts that you share from personal profiles to be shared outside of Facebook as the posts don't technically belong to your page, they belong to the user who posted it to their personal Facebook profile. There's an example of a post shared from a user's personal profile [here](https://smashballoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sharing-photo-facebook-profile.jpg "Example of Facebook post shared from personal profile").

Please note, this isn't a limitation of our plugin, it's a restriction which Meta (Facebook) places on its content in order to protect the privacy of their users.

**Potential solutions**

* You could re-post the Facebook post to your own page rather than just sharing it on your page. If you do this, then the content now originates from your Facebook page and will be displayed in the Facebook feed on your website.

* If you were to share a post from another page or public source, rather than sharing it from someone's personal Facebook profile, then it would show up in your feed outside of Facebook, but by default any posts that originate from a personal profile are protected by Facebook's privacy policy and is the private content of that profile owner.

= I'm receiving an error message when trying to display my Facebook posts =

Please refer to our [Error Message Reference page](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/docs/errors/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=errors "I'm receiving an error message when trying to display my Facebook posts") for information on how to resolve common error messages.

= The Custom Facebook Feed shortcode options aren't working =

The most common causes of this are:

1) There's HTML tags within the [custom-facebook-feed] shortcode which are preventing it from working correctly

If you copied and pasted the shortcode into the Visual editor on your WordPress page/post editor then it may have inadvertently included some HTML tags from the page that you copied it from. The easiest way to check this is to view the 'Text' view in your WordPress editor and see whether there are any stray HTML tags in the shortcode itself.

2) The shortcode includes curly single quote characters

If your shortcode includes single quotes then check that they are the standard single quotes and not the curly kind.

3) Typo in the shortcode option

Ensure that there aren't any spelling errors in the shortcode options that you're using and that the format is consistent with that demonstrated on the [Shortcode Options reference page](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/docs/shortcodes/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&utm_source=faq&utm_medium=shortcode "The shortcode options aren't working").

= Facebook avatar pictures aren't showing up in my feed =

The most common reason for this is that an add-on or extension you have installed in your web browser is blocking the pictures being loaded from Facebook. Try checking to see whether you have any add-ons or extensions installed in your browser and, if so, try disabling them to see whether that solves the problem and displays the pictures from Facebook.
