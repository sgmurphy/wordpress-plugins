##📢 IMPORTANT NEWS!

## In one of our newest versions, we introduced a new, remodelled and improved appointment booking form.

With this booking form, UX and UI are pushed to the next level. New appointment scheduling form is smoother, steps load faster and the conversion rate is higher.


##🏆 What makes new booking form the best on the market:

- **Modern design**

A new booking form is modern, looks attractive, and contains crucial booking-related information. The entire booking process consists of several intuitive and easy-to-navigate steps. We took a closer look at the behaviour of the users and improved the whole booking process for appointment and event booking. Each action your client needs during the booking process is disposable and a click away. The UI design of the new booking form skyrockets the UX improvement.

- **Category selection**

Navigation through a list of your services is easier compared to the old booking experience. During the appointment process, your clients can click through all service categories. All services are organized within dropdown menus, and grouped by categories. This type of preview gives them a detailed insight into all services you offer.

- **Smooth and animated step-to-step transition**

A step-to-step transition process is accelerated with modern loaders working from behind. Transitional animations appearing when moving from one step to another are modernizing the entire process, making the scheduling process more interesting.

- **Contact us option**

If your clients have any questions or concerns, they can contact you using clickable email that is positioned at a visible place. This feature is optional.

- **Sidebar with the selected booking-related details**

Display of the booking process in real-time is presented via sidebar. This is how finished and unfinished steps are differentiated. Before the definite scheduling confirmation, your clients can edit every process by clicking on the step back. This option helps them to navigate the booking process.

- **Larger booking calendar with available and unavailable time slots**

The booking calendar is larger, therefore each customer can easily see the difference between available and unavailable days.

- **A better summary of the finished booking**

The improved form offers easy tracking of all past bookings recapitulation out of the client dashboard.

- **Simple customization page**

You can effortlessly customize the form to extend where the look and feel match your brand needs. Designs you can achieve with new options are numerous. The form will appear to your users as more attractive.

- **Improved loading speed**

By adding more up-to-date technology and logic, we’ve managed to speed up the loading process. This is one of the crucial benefits. Your customer booking experience will become faster and smoother which will directly impact the number of finished bookings.

- **Improved conversion rate**

The intuitive, simple, informative, and fast-loading form will give your customers the joy of smooth and effortless usage. This will impact the customers’ retention rate increment.

## New Form vs Old Form

New booking form is faster to load, more insightful, more intuitive, easier to navigate, and comes with more customization options. Setting up the new booking form is easier, and the usage is straightforward. And what's most important, the new and improved Amelia Booking System is inviting and conversion-optimized.


***Note:** The old appointment booking form will be available until the total switch to the new form happens, which the users will be informed about in a timely manner.*

##FAQ

**Do you have a list of all Amelia Booking System shortcodes?**

Yes, here is the list of available shortcodes to show your booking system:

1. [ameliabooking] - If you offer services and appointments booking and want to show them in a step-by-step booking process.
2. [ameliacatalog] - If you offer a huge number of services and you want to show them in a Catalog booking view.
3. [ameliaevents] - If you offer event booking, this shortcode will allow you to show events in a form of a list.
4. [ameliastepbooking] - If you offer services and appointments booking and want to show them in a new improved step-by-step booking process.
5. [ameliacatalogbooking] - If you offer a huge number of services and you want to show them in a new more intuitive Catalog booking view.
5. [ameliaeventslistbooking] - If you offer event booking and would like to showcase them in a new, more intuitive Event List view.

**Where can I set a schedule?**

To set your working hours and assign services to each working period, go to the Settings page, open Provider Settings and you will see the Working hours tab where you can create different working periods for each day and choose which services will be available for booking in each period.

**I have configured my working hours and services but all dates are unavailable on the booking calendar, what should I do?**

The reason for this can be if your services have a duration longer than your working periods are, if a service cannot fit in the working period that date will be shown as unavailable on the calendar.

**Do you have integrations with page builders?**

Yes, of course, besides the Classic Editor and Gutenberg blocks, you can also use Divi and Elementor page builders to set up your booking form.

**Can I use the Amelia booking system in other languages?**

At the moment, Amelia Booking System has German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Belgian, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalonian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek, Arabic, Slovak, Finnish, Japanese, Polish, Czech, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese translations.

**Why doesn’t the color, configured in “Customize” apply to the front-end?**

When you apply a new style (change colors and font styles for the booking form) in the “Customize” section, you will need to delete the stored cache in your browser, for the changes to be visible on the front end. That is – the change is already there, and you can see it if you open an Incognito window, it’s just that the current browser session stored a cache with old style, and it needs to be clear for you to see it.

**I configured Notification settings, why aren’t the emails being sent?**

Some hosting providers don’t allow 3rd party SMTP settings (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) to be saved, and are intentionally blocking them because they use their own. If you configured the Notification Settings, and your emails are not being sent, please contact your hosting provider, and ask them if they are blocking the SMTP.
