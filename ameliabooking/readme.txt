## FAQ

**Do you have a list of all Amelia Booking System shortcodes?**

Yes, here is the list of available shortcodes to show your booking system:

1. [ameliabooking] - If you offer services and appointments booking and want to show them in a step-by-step booking process.
2. [ameliacatalog] - If you offer a huge number of services and you want to show them in a Catalog booking view.
3. [ameliaevents] - If you offer event booking, this shortcode will allow you to show events in a form of a list.
4. [ameliastepbooking] - If you offer services and appointments booking and want to show them in a new improved step-by-step booking process.
5. [ameliacatalogbooking] - If you offer a huge number of services and you want to show them in a new more intuitive Catalog booking view.
5. [ameliaeventslistbooking] - If you offer event booking and would like to showcase them in a new, more intuitive Event List view.

**Where can I set a schedule?**

To set your working hours and assign services to each working period, go to the Settings page, open Provider Settings and you will see the Working hours tab where you can create different working periods for each day and choose which services will be available for booking in each period.

**I have configured my working hours and services but all dates are unavailable on the booking calendar, what should I do?**

The reason for this can be if your services have a duration longer than your working periods are, if a service cannot fit in the working period that date will be shown as unavailable on the calendar.

**Do you have integrations with page builders?**

Yes, of course, besides the Classic Editor and Gutenberg blocks, you can also use Divi and Elementor page builders to set up your booking form.

**Can I use the Amelia booking system in other languages?**

At the moment, Amelia Booking System has German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Belgian, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalonian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Hungarian, Greek, Arabic, Slovak, Finnish, Japanese, Polish, Czech, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese translations.

**Why doesn‚Äôt the color, configured in ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù apply to the front-end?**

When you apply a new style (change colors and font styles for the booking form) in the ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù section, you will need to delete the stored cache in your browser, for the changes to be visible on the front end. That is ‚Äì the change is already there, and you can see it if you open an Incognito window, it‚Äôs just that the current browser session stored a cache with old style, and it needs to be clear for you to see it.

**I configured Notification settings, why aren‚Äôt the emails being sent?**

Some hosting providers don‚Äôt allow 3rd party SMTP settings (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) to be saved, and are intentionally blocking them because they use their own. If you configured the Notification Settings, and your emails are not being sent, please contact your hosting provider, and ask them if they are blocking the SMTP.
