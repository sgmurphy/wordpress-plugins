= File Integrity Checker =

The File Integrity Checker will compare your WordPress core files as well as your plugin and theme files to their original package. Its File Comparison Viewer will show you the differences between any modified file and the original. You can also [add your Premium themes and plugins](https://blog.nintechnet.com/ninjascanner-powerful-antivirus-scanner-for-wordpress/#integrity "") to the File Integrity Checker. Infected or corrupted files can be easily restored with one click.

= File Snapshot =

The File Snapshot will show you which files were changed, added or deleted since the previous scan.

= Database Snapshot =

NinjaScanner will compare all published posts and pages in the database with the previous scan and will report if any of them were changed, added or deleted.

= Anti-Malware Signatures =

You can scan your blog for potential malware and virus using the built-in signatures. The scanning engine is compatible with [Linux Malware Detect LMD](https://github.com/rfxn/linux-malware-detect "") (whose anti-malware signatures are included) and with some [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/ "") signatures as well. You can even [write your own anti-malware signatures](https://blog.nintechnet.com/ninjascanner-powerful-antivirus-scanner-for-wordpress/#signatures "").

= NinjaFirewall Integration =

If you are running our [NinjaFirewall (WP or WP+ Edition)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/ "Download NinjaFirewall") web application firewall plugin, you can use this option to integrate NinjaScanner into its menu.

= Fast and Lightweight Scanner =

NinjaScanner has strictly no impact on your database. It only uses it to store its configuration (less than 1Kb). It saves the scan data, report, logs etc on disk only, makes use of caching to save bandwidth and server resources. It also includes a Garbage Collector that will clean up its cache on a regular basis.

= Background Scans =

Another great NinjaScanner feature is that it runs in the background: start a scan, let it run and keep working on your blog as usual. You can even log out of the WordPress dashboard while a scanning process is running! You don't have to wait patiently until the scan has finished. Additionally, a scan report can be sent to one or more email addresses.

= Sandbox for quarantined files =

When moving a file to the quarantine folder, NinjaScanner can use a testing environment (a.k.a. sandbox) to make sure that this action does not crash your blog with a fatal error. If it does, it will warn you and will not quarantine the file. It is possible (but not recommended) to disable the sandbox.

= Advanced Settings =

NinjaScanner offers many advanced settings to finely tune it, such as exclusion filters, selection of the algorithm to use, a debugging log etc.

= Privacy Policy =

Your website can run NinjaScanner and be 100% compliant with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:

We, the authors, do not collect, share or sell personal information. We don't track or profile you. Our software does not collect any private data from you or your visitors.
