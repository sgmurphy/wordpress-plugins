The CFF plugin allows you to create both simple and professional forms. Its form builder includes dynamic calculated fields and many other controls.

== Description ==

Absolutely! The "<a href="https://cff.dwbooster.com/download">Calculated Fields Form</a>" plugin opens up a world of possibilities. Here's a breakdown of what you can achieve:

**Financial Calculations**: Design forms that automatically compute totals, taxes, discounts, and other financial metrics.

**Booking Forms**: Seamlessly handle date operations, availability checks, and booking calculations.

**Product Pricing**: Dynamically calculate product prices based on user inputs or predefined rules.

**Math Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic, percentages, and complex mathematical functions.

**Text Processing**: Manipulate text fields, concatenate strings, and format data.

**Date Operations**: Handle date differences, age calculations, and time-related tasks.

Advanced Operations:

**Distance Calculations**: Compute distances between locations.

**Chart Generation**: Create charts dynamically based on form data.

**Third-Party Service Integration**: Call external APIs or services for real-time data retrieval.

And the best part? All resulting forms are **mobile responsive**, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

The most remarkable aspect is that you don’t need to hire a developer to create forms. With basic knowledge, you can have professional forms in minutes.

== Other Notes ==

= Equation / Formula format for calculated fields =

Below, some possible formulas are included as examples, but the possibilities are endless.

* With simple mathematical operations:

    `fieldname1 + fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 * fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 / fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

* With mathematical operations involving multiple fields and grouped fields:

    `fieldname1 * (fieldname2 + fieldname3)`

* With rounding operations. Round the result to two decimal places:

    `PREC(fieldname2 / fieldname3, 2)`

* There are infinite number of formulas that can be created using complex structures. For example, the following formula includes conditional statements:

    `(function () {`
    `if (100 < fieldname3) return fieldname1 + fieldname2;`
    `if (fieldname3 <= 100) return fieldname1 * fieldname2;`
    `})();`

* For complex formulas/equations you must use the function format with return statement to return the result to the calculated field:

     `(function () {`
        `var result = 0;`
        `/* Your code here */`
        `return result;`
    `}) ();`

= Operations and operators to use in equations/formulas =

One of the "Calculated Fields Form" strengths is the ability to use any valid JavaScript code to implement the equations/formulas.

However, the plugin includes a wide variety of operations and operators to simplify the development process.

[Mathematical Operations and Operators](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#mathematical-module)

[Conditional Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#conditions-module)

[Field Handling Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#managing-fields-module)

[Operations for interacting with external services](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#connection-module)

[Operations for handling URLs and query strings](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#url-module)

In addition to the operation modules listed above, the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin include additional modules:

[Date Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#datetime-module)

[Financial Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#financial-module)

[Distance and Travel Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#distance-module)

[Operations to generate charts](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#chart-module)

= Create variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST", "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES" to use in the equations =

The plugin includes the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] to generate JavaScript variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST",  "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES":

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="..."]`

In the shortcode, you must replace the "..." symbols with the name of the parameter or variable. The variables are created as properties of the cff_var variable. For example, in the [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="my_var"] shortcode, you can access the variable value from the equations by using cff_var['my_var'], or cff_var.my_var

For example:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="varname"]`

You can use the variables generated through the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] in the formulas of the calculated fields: `fieldname1*cff_var.varname`

The complete list of parameters accepted by the variables shortcode is available at the following link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#javascript-variables)
