## Sitemap Structure

The plugin offers two primary XML Sitemap structures: **Single Sitemap** and **Sitemap Index**. The Single Sitemap displays all your website's content in a single XML Sitemap, while the Sitemap Index shows multiple XML Sitemaps in a single Sitemap Index.

**Sitemap Index** feature enables you to manage your sitemaps with **Multiple Inner Sitemaps** for various content types such as Pages, Posts, Custom Posts, Images, Videos and more. This feature makes easy the management of your Sitemaps and keep them organized.

## Google News

Make your website's News easily discoverable by Search Engines with Google News feature. By enabling "Google News" in the settings, a dynamic [Google News Sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/news-sitemap) will be created automatically. Google News Sitemap is fully compatible with popular multilingual plugins like **WPML**, **Polylang**, and **TranslatePress**.

The Google News Sitemap includes all the required fields such as **Publication Name**, **Language**, **Title**, and **Publication Date**. Additionally, it is fully compatible with the Google Publisher Center sitemap protocol, ensuring that your website's content is properly indexed and displayed in Google News.

## Image Sitemap

The Dynamic Image Sitemap is a valuable tool for optimizing website indexing and search engine visibility. By including images from Pages, Posts, and Custom Posts Content, it offers a comprehensive representation of visual content on your site. Additionally, its adherence to the [Google Image Sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/image-sitemaps) structure ensures compatibility and optimal performance within the search engine ecosystem.

## Video Sitemap

Video Sitemap will also be dynamically generated using collected Videos from Pages, Posts, and Custom Posts Content that contains Playlist Shortcode or <video> tag nd fully compatible with [Google Video Sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/video-sitemaps) structure. Title, Thumbnail, Description, and Duration fields will be respectively generated from Video Attachment's Title, Featured Image, Caption, and Length.

## Custom Sitemap URLs

Customizing your XML Sitemap is ease with Custom Sitemap URLs feature. You can add **External or Internal URLs** to your XML Sitemap under the Plugin Settings, making it easy to customize your XML Sitemap to fit your specific needs. Also, you can add **Custom Sitemaps** to the Sitemap Index, if you have Static or Additional Sitemaps.

In addition, Google XML Sitemaps Generator plugin allows you to display a Sitemap under a **Custom URL** on your website, providing an additional level of customization.

## Sitemap Options

This plugin provides you with a very simple and clean UI to set **Priority**, **Frequency** options and easily **Include/Exclude** Pages, Posts, Custom Posts, Archives, Authors, Categories, Taxonomies and Tags into your Sitemap.

## Cache

The WordPress XML Sitemap plugin comes equipped with a Cache feature that automatically caches Sitemap Data when a user visits the Sitemap page. This means that subsequent visits to the sitemap page will be faster as the cached data is quickly retrieved instead of generating the Sitemap from scratch.

Cache feature also includes options to set a **Caching Timeout**, view the **Last Cached Time**, and **Clear Cache** when necessary. These features help to improve the performance of your website and ensure that your Sitemap is always up-to-date for Search Engines to crawl.
